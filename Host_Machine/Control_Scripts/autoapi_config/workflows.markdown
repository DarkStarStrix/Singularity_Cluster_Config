# AutoAPI Workflows

## Overview
AutoAPI automates AI workflows for training, inference, and preprocessing in the Singularity Cluster. This document outlines key workflows and their configurations.

## Workflow Types
1. **Training Workflow**:
   - Executes model training on GPU/CPU nodes.
   - Inputs: Dataset, model architecture, hyperparameters.
   - Outputs: Trained model weights, training logs.
2. **Inference Workflow**:
   - Runs real-time or batch inference on GPU/CPU servers.
   - Inputs: Trained model, input data.
   - Outputs: Predictions, inference logs.
3. **Preprocessing Workflow**:
   - Prepares datasets for training (e.g., normalization, augmentation).
   - Runs on CPU servers for efficiency.

## Configuration
- Defined in `autoapi_config.yaml`.
- Supports dynamic scaling and fault tolerance (future implementation).

## TODO
- Add support for multi-node training pipelines.
- Implement workflow prioritization for resource allocation.
- Integrate with NAS for seamless data access.
