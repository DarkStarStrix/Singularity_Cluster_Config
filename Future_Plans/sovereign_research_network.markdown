# Sovereign Research Network

## Overview
The Sovereign Research Network is a long-term vision for a decentralized AI research hub built on the Singularity Cluster.

## Goals
- Provide independent researchers with access to on-prem AI compute.
- Host a global repository of open-source models and papers.
- Foster high-signal collaboration without institutional gatekeeping.

## Implementation Plan
1. Establish trusted nodes for external access (`trusted_node_protocol.md`).
2. Scale Cluster to support multi-billion parameter models.
3. Build a secure, decentralized platform for research sharing.

## TODO
- Define governance for the research network.
- Prototype node access workflows.
- Plan for cross-regional infrastructure.
