# Multi-Node Coordination

## Overview
Multi-node coordination enables the Singularity Cluster to scale compute across distributed nodes for large-scale AI training.

## Components
- **Scala**: Task scheduling and resource orchestration.
- **Rust CUDA**: Cross-node GPU optimization.
- **10GbE Networking**: Low-latency communication.

## Coordination Process
1. AutoAPI assigns tasks to nodes based on availability.
2. Scala manages data and compute distribution.
3. Rust CUDA optimizes GPU workloads across nodes.
4. Results aggregated and stored in NAS.

## TODO
- Implement fault-tolerant coordination algorithms.
- Optimize data transfer for billion-parameter models.
- Add monitoring for node synchronization.
