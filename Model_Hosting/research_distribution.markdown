# Research Distribution

## Overview
The Singularity Cluster shares research outputs (models, papers, logs) with the open-source community to foster decentralized AI development.

## Distribution Channels
- **GitHub**: Hosts model weights, code, and technical documentation.
- **Hugging Face**: Publishes models for fine-tuning and deployment.
- **Papers**: Technical papers submitted to open-access platforms (e.g., arXiv).

## Process
1. Train and validate models in the Cluster.
2. Version models and artifacts (`model_versioning_strategy.md`).
3. Upload to GitHub/Hugging Face with detailed documentation.
4. Announce releases via community channels.

## TODO
- Define criteria for public vs. private releases.
- Automate paper submission workflows.
- Establish partnerships with research communities.
