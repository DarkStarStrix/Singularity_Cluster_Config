# Trusted Node Protocol

## Overview
The Trusted Node Protocol governs secure access to Singularity Cluster models and resources for external researchers and collaborators.

## Principles
- **Security**: Cryptographic authentication for node access.
- **Decentralization**: Nodes operate independently but align with Cluster standards.
- **Transparency**: Audit logs for all node interactions.

## Protocol
1. Nodes authenticate using cryptographic keys (future Savant Card integration).
2. Access limited to specific models/datasets via `license_and_access_rights.md`.
3. Nodes report usage metrics to the Cluster for monitoring.

## TODO
- Implement key-based authentication system.
- Define node onboarding process.
- Integrate with `internal_ecosystem/savant_card_initiative.md`.
