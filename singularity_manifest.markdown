# Singularity Cluster Manifest

## Vision
The Singularity Cluster is a declaration of AI sovereignty, proving that an individual can build a world-class AI supercomputing system without corporate oversight or cloud dependency. It is a revolution in decentralized research, enabling high-signal creators to push the boundaries of AI and scientific discovery.

## Core Principles
1. **Autonomy**: Full ownership of compute, storage, and data, free from external restrictions.
2. **Scalability**: Modular architecture that grows incrementally to support billion-parameter models.
3. **Transparency**: Open-source model hosting and research distribution to foster global collaboration.
4. **Resilience**: Fault-tolerant design with distributed systems and robust storage.
5. **Mastery**: Engineered by a single individual, showcasing the power of technical expertise.

## Commitment
- Build a scalable, on-prem AI infrastructure rivaling FAANG systems.
- Enable independent researchers to access decentralized AI compute.
- Redefine AI development by prioritizing sovereignty, efficiency, and innovation.

## Roadmap
- **Short-Term**: Train million-parameter models, optimize AutoAPI and Rust CUDA.
- **Mid-Term**: Achieve multi-node coordination and fault-tolerant training.
- **Long-Term**: Train multi-billion parameter models, establish a decentralized research hub.
