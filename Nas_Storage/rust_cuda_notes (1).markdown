# Rust CUDA Notes

## Overview
Rust CUDA provides custom optimizations for GPU memory management and parallel processing in the Singularity Cluster.

## Key Features
- Direct control over CUDA kernels for training efficiency.
- Memory pooling to reduce allocation overhead.
- Support for NVLink-enabled multi-GPU setups.

## Implementation
- Integrated with GPU training nodes (`gpu_training/`).
- Used for optimizing deep learning workloads (PyTorch backend).
- Supports cross-node coordination via Scala.

## TODO
- Document specific Rust CUDA optimizations.
- Benchmark performance against standard CUDA.
- Add support for billion-parameter model training.
