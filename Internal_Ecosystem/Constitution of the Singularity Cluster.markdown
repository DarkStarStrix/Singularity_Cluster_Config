# Constitution of the Singularity Cluster
*Version 1.0 — Ratified 2025-05-03*

## Overview
This Constitution establishes the Singularity Cluster as a sovereign digital nation, defining its hierarchical structure, separation of powers, and disciplinary processes. It is the foundational legal framework, complemented by the Bill of Rights, Code of Conduct, Technical Charter, Membership Accord, and internal ecosystem protocols. For a comprehensive view, refer to the unified *Governance Document*.

## Preamble
The Singularity Cluster is an elite infrastructure collective governed by cybernetic law, designed for resilience, accountability, and stewardship. The Sysadmin, as sovereign architect, is balanced by the Crimson Red Council and Legendary Tier, forming a trinity of executive authority, security oversight, and institutional memory.

## §1 — Hierarchy and Membership Classes
1. **Sysadmin (Executive)**: Holds presidential root authority for patching and emergency overrides. Cannot unilaterally delete Legendary or Crimson members, override panopticon audit logs, or amend this Constitution.
2. **Crimson Red Council (Security + Legal Oversight)**: 10–20 members responsible for infrastructure security, cybersecurity, audits, legal counsel, and constitutional enforcement. Can initiate disciplinary motions.
3. **Legendary Tier (Stewards & High Governance)**: 100–200 core contributors and philosophical custodians with veto rights and co-initiation powers for impeachment.
4. **Elite Tier (Senior Contributors)**: 100–1,000 members who influence system direction via merit and escalate concerns.
5. **General Membership (Pro & Basic Users)**: No fixed limit, with rights to submit feedback and seek promotion based on contribution.

*See Membership Accord for detailed tier responsibilities.*

## §2 — Separation of Powers and Checks
1. **Sysadmin Powers**: Root access, ability to remove non-Legendary/Crimson users, propose amendments, and suspend lower tiers with cause. Subject to suspension or removal via §3.
2. **Mutual Accountability**: Sysadmin can investigate Legendary or Crimson members for corruption or abuse with one co-signature and majority vote (50%+1 Crimson Red or 2/3 Legendary).

## §3 — Disciplinary Process & Safeguards
1. **Motion of Contempt**: Initiated by 2 Legendary + 1 Crimson Red member, leading to a vote on Sysadmin fitness (2/3 supermajority required). Outcomes include suspension or Nuclear Option.
2. **Nuclear Option**: Permanent revocation of Sysadmin powers with 2/3 supermajority from both Crimson Red and Legendary Tiers, followed by emergency election.
3. **Suspension & Reinstatement**: Temporary bans with reinstatement requiring apology and majority approval.

*See Code of Conduct for compliance and enforcement.*

## §4 — Internal Escalation and Oversight
1. **Escalation Flow**: Issues escalate from General Membership to Elite Tier, then to Crimson Red for investigation or motions.
2. **Open Reporting System**: Anonymous, immutable audit log for all users, visible to Legendary and Crimson Red.

*See Communication Protocols for escalation details.*

## §5 — Amendment Protocol
Amendments proposed by Sysadmin with Crimson Red co-sign or 2/3 Crimson Red vote, ratified by 2/3 Legendary Tier majority, logged in version-controlled records.

## §6 — Cultural and Operational Clause
1. **Panopticon Clause**: Governance behavior is observable via audit logs, ensuring accountability.
2. **Contribution-Based Meritocracy**: Promotions are merit-based, requiring nomination and vote.

## §7 — Emergency Operations
Crimson Red quorum (10/20) may restore a suspended Sysadmin for emergency cluster defense.
